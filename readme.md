Nathan's Cortex-M Project FreeRTOS
----------------------------------

This is a Cortex-M only copy of FreeRTOS (currently at V9.0.0rc1) for my own projects.  I offer no assurances of frequent updates or meaningful changelogs.  I'm just using this repository so I can submodule it into a few other projects without dragging around a load of ports I don't want or relying on someone else to copy it into Git for me.
